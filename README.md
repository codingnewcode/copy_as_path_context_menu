# What is it

Adds a "Copy as path" in the context menu, with "" wrapping it.

Very useful context menu integration

credit goes to [winhelponline.com](https://www.winhelponline.com/blog/copy-as-path-always-show-right-click-windows-10/?expand_article=1) which i just took the code from, and removed the icon for less distraction in context menu.

# How to use

simply run the .reg file (i only tested it on windows 10, may or not work on other systems)
